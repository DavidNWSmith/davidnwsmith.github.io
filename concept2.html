<p>In part 1 of this paper I presented the theorems of the exclusive-OR algebra, that is
Boolean algebra based on the exclusive-OR (XOR) and AND operators, and demonstrated that
this algebra is a complete Boolean algebra in its own right and has useful applications
for the design of digital circuits and CPLDs. I also showed how to use a conventional
Karnaugh map, or K-map, to deal with this algebra. In this article I will continue my
assertion that exclusive-OR algebra has the required methods for simplification that are
necessary to make this algebra convenient and useful for the design of digital circuits.</p>

<p>Part 1 of this paper describes all the preliminary requirements for understanding the
content of this paper. You should refer back to that if you are unsure of these details. I
have reproduced the list of theorems of XOR algebra and the canonical forms here for
reference. The figure numbers in this paper continue on from the figure numbers in Part 1
as posted in these pages. The figure numbers are not continuous with the &quot;New
Logic&quot; article figure numbers.</p>

<p>In this article I describe my approach to the simplification of XOR functions. Over
recent years a number of alternative approaches have been described in the literature. To
a large extent my approach has been independent of this literature. Consequently my
terminology may differ slightly from current practise. Most of this literature is intended
for the use of specialists and it is clear that there is a great deal of interest and
research going on in this field. A link to a comprehensive source of this literature is in
Part 3 of these pages. My articles on this subject are not specifically intended for
specialists and I have endeavoured to make them readable rather than concise.</p>

<p>The method I describe is readily useable, for working with paper and pencil, for up to
6 variables. You may need a bit of practice with it before you get up to speed with it.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the discussion of Figure 4, in the first part of this paper (Figure 9
in the &quot;New Logic&quot; article), simplification by inspection of a K-map of
functions of more than three variables may not be immediately obvious. Consequently we
would like to have a systematic procedure for finding such simplifications. I will
describe my approach, including my method of dealing with redundancies, which gives an
easily useable and systematic algebraic procedure for the simplification of XOR forms of
Boolean functions. The method will be described with examples.</p>

<p>Assuming that the function is given in inclusive-OR form, the first step I take is to
expand the function into canonical form, as it is for the Quine-McCluskey method for
simplifying AND, OR invert functions. This is so that we can use theorem T10 to get the
function into XOR form in the C1 canonical form. Next we expand with T4, x' = x <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> 1, to eliminate all primed variables, to convert the expression to
the C2 canonical form. A good many terms cancel out using T1 and T3. We can use a tabular
or chart arrangement to reduce the work of producing this form. This is described in the
next section.</p>

<p>You may recall that simplification methods for the AND, OR invert algebra depended on
making systematic use of the relation: x + x' = 1 and the distributive theorem. You then
look for prime implicants.</p>

<p>For the XOR algebra we will make systematic use of the relation: x <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
x' = 1, mainly in the form 1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> x = x' and the distributive
theorem T9 using the C2 form of the function as a starting point. The idea of looking for
prime implicants is not appropriate here. You can of course apply the simplification
procedures to be described with the function not strictly in C2 form but this may not save
any effort particularly if there are many variables in the function.</p>

<p>Function f<sub>1</sub> from Figure 4 will be used for illustrating the procedure. To
refresh your memory once again this function was:</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right">f<sub>1 </sub></td>
    <td>= a'b'c + a'cd + bc'd + ac'd' + abd'</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= a'b'cd' + a'b'cd + a'bc'd + a'bcd + ab'c'd' + abc'd' + abc'd + abcd'</td>
    <td>,Expanded to C1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b'c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bd <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ac'd.</td>
    <td>,Result given</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To draw up the chart write down all C2 terms across the page as headings to columns.
Allow one column on the left hand side of the page to list all the C1 terms taken from the
K-map for the function. Each of the C1 terms will be expanded to form C2 terms. C2 terms
consist of the number 1, all the variables singly, all possible pairs of variables, then
all triples of variables and so on up to a column for all the variables in a term. Refer
to Figure 8 for details of the construction. A '1' is placed in the columns for the C2
terms derived from each C1 term in the row for the C1 term. To see the rule for doing this
we will expand one of the C1 terms. For example;</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right">a'b'cd' </td>
    <td>= (1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a)(1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
    b)c(1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> d)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= (1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab)c(1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> d)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= c(1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> d <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
    ad <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bd <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> abd)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Without finishing the last line of the expansion you can see that the expansion will
lead to all the C2 terms that have the variable <b>c</b> in them. Hance in the chart we
place a 1 in all columns that have a <b>c</b> somewhere in their C2 term, in the row for
the C1 term.</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig8.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="12" alt="The chart for deriving C2 terms from C1 terms" WIDTH="508" HEIGHT="240">If you try the same thing with a C1
term that has two unprimed variables in it then you will find that you get all C2 terms
that have both of the unprimed variables in them. You can see that this is going to happen
from the development of the example. The same result applies to C1 terms with larger
numbers of unprimed variables. Therefore the general rule for filling 1s in the columns is
that you take the unprimed variables in the C1 terms and place 1s in all the columns that
have the same variables in their C2 terms in the row for the C1 term. If there are no
unprimed variables in a C1 term you place 1s in all columns. To get the function in the
final C2 form you of course cross out all columns that have an even number of 1s in them.
You now have the function in a convenient exclusive-OR form for starting the minimisation
process. For large tables, the use of a spreadsheet program can save a lot of work drawing
up the table.</p>

<font FACE="Arial"><i><b><a name="The simplification">The simplification</a> process</p>
</b></i></font>

<p>The algebraic method sets out to reduce the given function to minimal form by the
systematic application of a small number of reduction or simplification rules. The
function will be defined as minimal when further opportunities for applying the rules are
exhausted. ie. No further reductions are possible. There are often alternative ways of
expressing a function in terms of the XOR operator. The function minimised on the basis
of the above definition is a good starting point for arranging the final expression the
way you want it. I might add that the procedure is easier to do than the explanation would
suggest.</p>
<b>

<p>Simplification rule 1.</b> Consider two terms one of which has n+1 variables in it. We
will call this term <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>. The other term has n variables all of
which are the same as n of the variables in <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> and with the same
exponents, i.e. truth values. We will call this term <font FACE="Symbol">b. </font>After
taking out the common factor you eliminate the <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> term when you
complement the extra variable in the <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> term. Simplification
rule 1 says that you should do this, starting with the terms with the most variables. This
rule follows from T9, the distributive theorem and T4, 1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> x =
x'. You can see that we are starting to go back the other way and reintroduce primed
variables but now with many duplicate terms eliminated.</p>
<b>

<p>Simplification rule 2.</b> Consider the same two terms <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> and
<font FACE="Symbol">b</font> with the same arrangement of variables. However, this time
one of the n variables has the opposite exponent to the corresponding variable in the
other term. We can reverse the exponent of this variable by adding a term <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> with n-1 variables, where the n-1 variables are the same as the
variables that are the same in <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> and <font FACE="Symbol">b</font>.
We add the term <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> twice to avoid changing the function. One of
the <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> terms is eliminated to complement the exponent of the
variable in the <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> term that had a different exponent. The <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> term can now be eliminated by simplification rule 1. Simplification
rule 2 is to do this. The following example should make this clear. In the following
expressions 'g' represents the remaining variables:</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right">abg <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'g </td>
    <td>= abg <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'g <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= abg <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g(1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a')
    <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= abg <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ag <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= ab'g <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> g</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We have effectively eliminated one of the variables in the <font FACE="Symbol">b</font>
term. To use this rule you would not actually perform all the intermediate steps. You
would go to the result directly. Rule 2 can be extended to the case where two or more of
the exponents of <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> differ from the corresponding exponents of <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>. An additional <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> term is added for each
application of rule 2 until the <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> term can be eliminated. The
additional terms <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> can often be eliminated in subsequent
working.</p>

<p>The whole of this procedure can be done in one line of working by adding the <font FACE="Symbol">g</font> terms one by one, at the same time modifying the exponents on the
variables of <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> until <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> is eliminated
and finally modifying the extra variable of <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>. For example:</p>

<p><img src="Concepts/eqn1.gif" alt="eqn1.gif (787 bytes)" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="61"></p>

<p>Rule 2 should be carried out to completion wherever possible. The effect of this rule
is to eliminate all the <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> terms that have the same variables as
the <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> terms. The rule is not applicable to <font FACE="Symbol">b</font>
terms whose variables are not all the same as the variables of the <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>
terms. Also the rule is not applicable if <font FACE="Symbol">b</font> has less than n
terms. Consequently an easily recognisable point is reached at which no further
application of the rule is possible.</p>
<b>

<p>Simplification rule 3.</b> If two terms contain the same number of variables and the
variables of each are the same but with different exponents, then both terms can be made
to have the same exponents and can therefore be eliminated by the addition of one less
variable terms by the procedure of rule 2. Rule 3 is that this procedure should be applied
wherever possible.</p>

<p>The rules are applied to the terms with the most variables first. We then work our way
down to terms with fewer variables. The function is regarded as minimal when no further
applications of these rules is possible. The minimal function that results is
characterised as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table border="1" width="78%">
    <tr>
      <td width="90%">If there are <i>n</i> variables represented in the function there will be
      at most only one term containing all <i>n</i> variables. If a term exists with all <i>n</i>
      variables present there will be no term containing <i>n - 1</i> variables</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="90%">If the terms containing the largest number of variables contain <i>m &lt;
      n</i> variables, then such terms that have all variables the same can be completely
      eliminated if there are an even number of such terms and reduced to a single term if there
      are an odd number of such terms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="90%">The remaining terms containing <i>m - 1</i> variables are completely
      combined with <i>m-</i>variable terms that have variables in common with them at the same
      time producing <i>(m -2)-</i>variable terms. The procedure is continued from the <i>(m -
      2)-</i>variable level without further consideration of the <i>m-</i>variable terms.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig9.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="12" alt="The K-map for funjction f1" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="240">Starting
with the function in C2 form it is possible to carry out the entire simplification process
in one line of working thus avoiding much repetitive writing out. This is done by adding
additional terms as they are needed, modifying exponents and crossing out terms as they
are eliminated. For the example that we used at the start of this section there are only
two steps possible:</p>

<p><img src="Concepts/eqn2.gif" alt="eqn2.gif (955 bytes)" WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="81"></p>

<p>Application of these 3 rules will very often be sufficient to minimise the XOR
function. However, recombinations can sometimes be made to reduce the total number of
product terms.</p>

<p>The function may contain the constant 1 and terms containing two variables each. If
there are two such terms one of which contains a variable p say and the other the
complement of this variable p', then the constant 1 can be eliminated by the substitution
p <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> p' = 1 and application of rule 1. (If the function
contained the constant 1 and a term with one variable, you could get rid of the 1 by
simply inverting the single variable).</p>

result can be generalised to enable a term with a single variable to be combined with two

<p>In some cases it may be possible to recombine two single variable terms into a single
two variable term as in the following example:</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="left">e.g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab'c </td>
    <td>= ab <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab'c</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= ab' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab'c</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= a'b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ab'c'</td>
    <td>...(R2)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This principle can be generalised to terms with larger numbers of variables as in the
following identity:</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="left">e.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ga <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
    gb <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> gab'c </td>

  </tr>

<p>To further illustrate the technique another worked example is shown in Figure 10. The
bullets at the top of the chart mark the terms in the C2 expansion. The function has been
chosen to represent as many features as possible.</p>

<p>The minimal expression obtained may often be written with different permutations of the
primes. Two cases are:</p>

<table class="formula">

<p>As an example f<sub>1</sub> can be written as: f<sub>1</sub> = a' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
b'c' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bd' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ac'd ,by T12a</p>

<p>T12a and b can often be used to make it possible to use R1 or R2 when these are not
initially in the right form.</p>

<p>There are special cases where this simplification method does not lead to the minimum
solution.</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>

    <td><p align="right">f </td>

</table>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig10.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="12" alt="A five variable example" WIDTH="552" HEIGHT="360">The
second line above is the C2 form and the third line is one of six possible solutions. Each
of the solutions has three terms compared with two terms for the function given in line 1.
You would simply reject the solution in this case. The + in the first line can be either
the inclusive or the exclusive OR, since the two terms are disjoint.</p>

<p>After the minimal form has been found it is sometimes possible to take advantage of
common factors to reduce the number of XOR operators in the representation of the
function.</p>

<p>Recalling that a NAND gate has the form (ab)' you can see that the right hand side of
this result can be implemented with either four NAND gates or perhaps three product terms
in a CPLD macrocell depending on your preferred implementation.</p>

procedure</i></b></font></p>

<p>Redundancies otherwise known as don't care conditions are terms that cannot physically
occur and therefore it is immaterial whether they appear in the function or not. There is
no difficulty taking advantage of redundancies when the K-map approach is used. Redundant
terms are simply either mapped an even or odd number of times whichever suits the
solution. However, in the algebraic approach to simplification you may not know in advance
whether to use a particular redundancy or not prior to performing the simplification
process. You could check to see if the redundant terms help to eliminate any terms in the
C1 to C2 conversion process. However, more generally you would first perform the complete
simplification process with the redundancies set to zero. Any terms amongst the
redundancies would then be considered for adding to the minimal function for further
minimising the function.</p>

<p>Consider the function:</p>

<p>f(a,b,c) = <font FACE="Symbol">S</font>(1,2,4) = a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> abc, with the redundant term abc.</p>

<p>The term abc (7) is not included in the original function. It can simply be cancelled
out. Next consider the function:</p>

<p>f(a,b,c,d) = <font FACE="Symbol">S</font>(2,3,4,5,7,8,9,14) = a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bcd, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the redundant term bcd'.</p>

<p>Here the redundant term can be applied to reinitiate the simplification process as
follows (step by step):</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right">a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
    c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bcd </td>
    <td>= a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bcd <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bcd'</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>

    <td>= a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bc(d <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> d')</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b'c</td>

    <td>= a' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b'c'</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig11.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="12" alt="Implicants of the redundancies" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="501">To assist the process of using redundancies you can
first obtain a list of implicants of the redundancies by applying the first part of the
Quine-McCluskey simplification process to them. Implicants that have variables in common
with terms in the minimal function with as few differences in exponents as possible are
then added to the minimal function and the simplification process continued as each
redundant term is added. An example will show some of the possibilities:</p>

<p>f<sub>3</sub> = a'b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'c' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>
ab'c'd', will be simplified using the list of implicants shown in Figure 11. You can
recognise these as the redundancies in a BCD number. F<sub>3</sub> is part of a code
converter. An oblique stroke / in front of a term indicates that the term has been
deleted.</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="right"><p align="right">f<sub>3</sub> </td>
    <td>
      = /a'b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /a'c' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /ab'c'd'
      <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /abc'd' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /ac'd'
      <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /acd' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ad''
      <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /ab <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b
      <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> /ac' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>/a

  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ad</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The added terms were: abc'd', acd', ab, ac</p>

<p>If you would like a bit of practice try to prove the following results using the same
set of implicants of redundancies:</p>

<table class="formula">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right">f<sub>4</sub> </td>
    <td>= a'bc' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> ac'd <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bc'd</td>
    <td><p align="right">f<sub>5</sub> </td>
    <td>= a'd' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'bc' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b'c'd</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>= ad <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> bc'd'</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>= c' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a'd' <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b'c'd'</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It is possible to elaborate the subject further with the application to multiple output
circuits. Without going into full details here, one approach is to use T11 to provide
opportunities for creating sub-functions that can reduce the total number of product terms
required to implement multiple output circuits that have common variables.</p>

<p>This concludes the demonstration that exclusive-OR logic is both a complete Boolean
algebra in its own right and has all the&nbsp; graphical and algebraic simplification
methods necessary for working with this algebra at least with paper and pencil.
Exclusive-OR logic together with inclusive-OR logic makes Boolean algebra a more complete
methodology for working with the logic of digital circuits. The examples given show how to
manipulate functions in exclusive-OR form. The algebraic simplification method described
in this paper can readily be used with paper and pencil for up to six variables after a
bit of practice.</p>

<p>Part 3 considers the question of multiple solutions that one finds with exclusive OR
logic minimisation. The link to the list of references can also be found in Part 3.</p>
