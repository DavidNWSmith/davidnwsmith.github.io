<p>I remember once having a book on switching circuit theory that developed its subject in
terms of the exclusive-OR (ExOR) operator rather than the more usual inclusive-OR (InOR or
just OR) operator. (You may recall that the ExOR operator includes one or the other of two
inputs but not both, whereas the InOR includes both inputs as well). Over time the book
has become lost. However, since that time Boolean algebra based on the ExOR operator
appears to have been completely ignored in popular books on digital design theory.</p>

<p>This paper will demonstrate the following points: 

<ol>
  <li>That a complete Boolean algebra can be developed in terms of the ExOR and AND operators.</li>
  <li>That this algebra is a necessary part of Boolean algebra and augments rather than
    replaces the more familiar algebra based on the OR operator.</li>
  <li>That this algebra has both map methods and algebraic simplification methods for Boolean
    functions that are no harder to use than the corresponding methods for InOR algebra.</li>
  <li>That this more complete algebra has useful applications if you are designing with
    programmable logic devices.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have come to this page from the Boolean Algebra pages then some of the
preliminary material presented here will already be familiar to you. If you have not yet
read the Boolean Algebra pages then you will find some additional material in those pages
relevant to the material presented here. In particular I derive all the preliminary theory
needed for this subject without undue formality.</p>

<p>A motivation for studying ExOR algebra is that in general a significant proportion of
logic functions can be represented with fewer terms if ExOR gates are used in the
representation of the functions. Many CPLDs contain an ExOR gate in their macrocells,
therefore a systematic way of making the best use of these ExOR gates should be part of
every digital designers stock in trade.</p>

<p>In this paper I will go as far as describing how ExOR and OR operators can both be
dealt with on the same conventional Karnaugh map (K-map). My approach does not depend on
or make use of methods described in the literature as Reed-Muller algebra or the pattern
recognition method sometimes seen. This paper is a condensed version of a more complete
paper on this subject that appeared in &quot;Electronics World magazine, February 1999
edition, pages 113 - 118&quot;. The proofs of the basic theorems can be found in the
Boolean Algebra pages or you can find them in the Electronics World article. Algebraic
simplification is covered in Part 2 of this article.</p>

<p>The ExOR operator conforms to the mathematical requirements of linearity. The
properties of this result leads to a whole branch of applications particularly in
communications systems. However, the emphasis in this paper is on the development and
application of ExOR algebra for the design of digital circuitry. Consequently this paper
will concentrate on the development of ExOR algebra as an essential part of Boolean
algebra for the design of digital circuits and will not go into the communications
applications of this operator.</p>

<p>Boolean algebra has variables and constants. We can think of these variables and
constants as having only two values, which we will take as 0 and 1. In this paper the
discussion is limited to two valued Boolean algebra. We can assign meanings to these
values when we consider the practical implementation of the Boolean functions that
represent a finished circuit. We can develop the algebra independently of any physical
meaning that we attach to the algebra.</p>

<p>Digital circuitry has a variety of basic gate structures such as AND gates, OR gates,
NAND gates and so on as well as inverters. The AND, OR and other gates can be thought of
as binary operators and inversion as a unary operator, due to the number of inputs
applicable in each case. If you consider the truth tables for the basic gate circuits you
can construct a total of 16 of these truth tables. Similarly there are potentially 4 unary
operators. A complete list of all the possible binary and unary operators for two valued
(ie. binary) Boolean algebra is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p><img src="Concepts/ExORfig1.gif" alt="The binary and unary operators of Boolean algebra." align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" WIDTH="542" HEIGHT="378">The original Figure 1 that appeared on this page has been replaced with a new
Figure 1 shown opposite. This has been drawn up to more clearly identify the distinctly
different binary operators of Boolean algebra. This has been done by showing the equations
for each of the sixteen possible cases of binary operators. Figure 1 shows that after
removing the two constants and the single variable cases there are four variations of AND
functions, four variations of OR functions and two variations of ExOR functions. The
number of variations of the AND OR functions are due to the number of variations of the
exponents of the variables. There are four variations of the exponents of two variables.
The NAND (1110) and NOR (1000) operators are seen to be included in the variations of the
OR and the AND operators respectively. There are only two variations of the ExOR functions
due to the even/odd characteristics of these functions. There are therefore three
distinctly different binary operators of Boolean algebra, the AND, OR and ExOR operators.
Greater details of these considerations are given in the paper on Boolean Algebra - Page 1
found on this site.</p>

<p>Boolean algebra as commonly presented is constructed from only two of these three
operators. To be more logical we should include the ExOR algebra to make Boolean algebra
more complete. The ExOR algebra becomes a second complete Boolean algebra which can be
used in conjunction with InOR algebra. By a complete Boolean algebra is meant that any
arbitrary function of Boolean variables can be constructed from it. The way that this will
be established is through the canonical expansions for the algebra. You can also see from
Figure 1 that there is only one unary or inversion operator for this algebra.</p>

<p>All Boolean functions have an inverse function. For example if <em>f</em> is a Boolean
function, then 1<font size="3" FACE="Symbol"></font><em> f</em> is its inverse. The two
ExOR functions are inverses of each other and the AND and OR functions in Figure 1 are
inverses of each other in pairs, a circumstance that leads to the duality in InOR algebra.</p>

<p>We could conceivably make other algebras from the available operators but that is
something you can try out yourself if you wish. This paper will mainly concentrate on the
ExOR algebra constructed together with the AND operator. A third algebra can be
constructed with the inclusive-OR operator together with the inverse of the ExOR operator.
See the added note at the end of part 2 of the Boolean Algebra Revisited pages for
details.</p>

<p>First we will look at the InOR theorems listed below. There is a group of four theorems
for each binary operator made up by applying a variable to one input and 0, 1, the
variable or the variable inverted as the second input. Then there are the commutative,
associative and distributive laws, then the inversion theorem and finally simplification
relationships.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">The theorems have been labelled for convenience of reference but
the labels and order of the theorems are completely arbitrary. You can see that each of
the three basic operators has its own set of the first four theorems listed. A difference
to the InOR theorems to notice is the inversion theorems given by T4, T5 and T6.
DeMorgan's theorem is not applicable here. This results in a different interpretation for
duality as applicable to ExOR algebra. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>

</b>

<p>The duality principle which states that &quot;Given any of the basic theorems of
Boolean algebra, changing OR operators to AND operators, AND operators to OR operators and
changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s where these occur leads to another of the basic
theorems&quot; applies specifically to the AND and OR operators.</p>

<p>Take a look at the summary of the theorems for the ExOR logic. Apply the inversion
theorem T5 to theorem T1 and you get theorem T2. Do the same with T3 and you get T4. And
the same applies when you go the other way round. This makes T1, T2 and T3, T4 dual pairs.</p>
<font size="3">

<p>Now apply the transposition theorem T11 to T1 and you get T3. Apply theorem T11 to T2
and you get T4. Once again the same applies when you go the other way round. This makes
T1, T3 and T2, T4 dual pairs. ExOR logic has a double duality property which makes the
ExOR a very flexible system of logic. Any of the basic theorems can be transformed into
any of the others by either inversion and/or transposition.</font></p>

</b>

<p>T10 can be used for expressing a function, given in terms of the OR operator, in terms
of the ExOR operator. The function in terms of the OR operator is expanded to minterm
form, so that all terms are disjoint (ie the product of any two terms is 0). The +
operators can then be replaced with <font FACE="Symbol"><b></b></font> operators. </p>

<p>This means that any function can be expressed in ExOR form directly from its truth
table or K-map. A canonical form for the exclusive OR operator is therefore with three
variables:</p>
<b>

<p></b>C1. f(abc) = <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>0</sub>a'b'c' <font FACE="Symbol"></font>
<font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>1</sub>a'b'c <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>2</sub>a'bc' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>3</sub>a'bc
<font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>4</sub>ab'c' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>5</sub>ab'c <font FACE="Symbol"></font>
<font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>6</sub>abc' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">a</font><sub>7</sub>abc<font SIZE="2"><b></p>
</b>

<p></font><font size="3">where: <font FACE="Symbol">a </font><sub>i</sub> = 1,0 depending
on whether the</font> i<sup>th</sup><font size="3"> term is present or not. Expressions
like this are sometimes referred to as Exclusive-OR Sum-Of-Products or ESOPs in the
literature.</p>

<p>An alternative canonical form (found by expanding all primed variables with T4 (x' = x <font FACE="Symbol"></font> 1) multiplying out and cancelling duplicate terms with T3 and T1)
is:</p>
<b>

<p></b><font size="3">C2. f(abc) = <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>0</sub> <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>1</sub>a <font FACE="Symbol"></font>
<font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>2</sub>b <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>3</sub>c <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>4</sub>ab
<font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>5</sub>ac <font FACE="Symbol"></font> <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>6</sub>bc <font FACE="Symbol"></font>
<font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>7</sub>abc</font><b></p>
</b>

<p><font size="3">where: <font FACE="Symbol">b</font><sub>i</sub> = 1,0 depending on
whether the </font>i<sup>th</sup><font size="3"> term is present or not.</p>

<p>You can generalise these expressions for an arbitrary number of variables using sigma
notation. However, I will simply assume that you can get the idea from the above
representations. Other canonical forms are possible, for example you can replace all
unprimed variables with primed variables instead of replacing all primed variables with
unprimed variables. However, the two canonical forms shown are sufficient for the purpose
of this paper.</p>

<p>The canonical expansions imply that any Boolean function can be expressed in terms of
the AND and ExOR operators. ExOR algebra is therefore a <i>complete Boolean algebra</i>.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>A theorem that gives exclusive OR logic an unusual degree of freedom is T11.</p>

<p>By means of this theorem any given term or expression can be made to be a part of any
other expression of the same variables.</p>

<p>For example, let <b>x = ac' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> a'bc</b> and suppose that the
term <b>h = ac</b> is to be made a part of this expression.</p>

<table CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="560">
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="69" VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3">Then,</font></td>
    <td WIDTH="463" VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3"><b>g = x <font FACE="Symbol"></font> h = ac'
    <font FACE="Symbol"></font> a'bc <font FACE="Symbol"></font> ac = a(c' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> c) <font FACE="Symbol"></font> a'bc = a <font FACE="Symbol"></font>
    a'bc.</b></font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="69" VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3">Therefore,</font></td>
    <td WIDTH="463" VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3"><b>x = g <font FACE="Symbol"></font> h = a <font FACE="Symbol"></font> a'bc <font FACE="Symbol"></font> ac</b>.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>As a check, this could have been obtained in this simple case directly from the given
expression for x by replacing <b>c'</b> with <b>(1 <font FACE="Symbol"></font> c)</b>
and expanding by T9 the distributive property.</p>

<p>You might want to use this idea if you want to find out if a single variable, with a
single ExOR operator will give an expression with fewer product terms than the original
expression. Let <b>p</b> be the single variable in function <b>f</b>, then evaluate <b>g =
f <font FACE="Symbol"></font> p</b>. If this expression or its inverse has fewer product
terms as required then <b>g</b> is the required result. ie. <b>f&nbsp;=&nbsp;g&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol"></font>&nbsp;p</b> or<b> f = g' <font FACE="Symbol"></font> p'</b>. You
would need to evaluate <b>g</b> for each variable in turn and take the best result, or you
might stop with the first good result if any. The Altera MaxPlus II system makes use of
this result.</p>

<p>The idea described in the previous paragraph is not limited to single variables, you
can apply the idea to any desired function of the same variables. This theorem makes a
good starting point for multi output circuit design with ExOR functions. Another example
of the use of this theorem is to construct a Gray code to binary code converter circuit.
Refer to the &quot;Electronics World&quot; article for the details of this example. I also
mention it briefly in the Boolean Algebra pages.</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="189" alt="Figure 2">There are many cases like this for functions of three variables. However,
often this approach may not be so easy to carry out. Fortunately the K-map technique can
be readily adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>First consider the ExOR function plotted on a K-map as shown in Figure 2. The K-map
technique for the ExOR function depends on T10 and the extended forms of T1 and T3.</p>

<p>Plotting the variables x and y individually on the map results in minterm xy being
plotted twice, consequently by the extended form of T1, this term will disappear from the
ExOR form.</p>

<p>Similarly by the extended form of T3, where the minterm is plotted once or an odd
number of times it will be retained.</p>

<p>Generalising this observation for the ExOR form gives the rules: 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <b><p>Any minterm that is to be included in the function must be plotted an odd number of
    times.</p>
    <p>Any minterm that is to be excluded from the function must be plotted an even (or zero)
    number of times.</b></p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>Two examples of this result are shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p>The first result is the example given at the start of this section. You can see that
one minterm <b>a'bc</b> has been plotted twice and is therefore excluded from the
equation.</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig3.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="196" alt="Figure 3"> The second example is the function that had the same form for the ExOR
operators as it had for the AND, OR, Invert operators. Here one term has been plotted
three times and is therefore included in the function. With a little practice the ExOR
forms can be readily found for three variable functions and sometimes for four variable
functions. Figure 4 shows two examples of four variable ExOR functions.</p>

<p>A procedure for using the K-map to find opportunities for simplification of a logic
expression by using an ExOR gate (by inspection) is to look for a grouping of 1s that
could be simplified if an extra square or squares between them are filled in with 1s to
combine the terms. This is applicable if only one ExOR is needed to represent the
function. The following examples show a more general approach where more than one ExOR is
needed.</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig4.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="224" alt="Figure 4"> To plot a function given in exclusive OR form, simply plot individual
terms by placing 1s in all squares for the term and cancel all squares that have an even
number of 1s.</p>

<p>Don't care conditions are treated in the K-map approach the same way as for the
inclusive OR case, the don't care term is either used or not as required. For the ExOR
function don't care terms can be plotted an even or odd number of times.</p>

<p>In the case of f<sub>1</sub> in Figure 4 the minimal ExOR form of the equation may not
be so easily found by inspection. Here we would like to have an algebraic simplification
procedure. An easy to use and systematic procedure is described in part 2 of this paper.</p>

equations</h4>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig5.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" alt="Figure 5" WIDTH="379" HEIGHT="351">Two more examples
are shown in Figures 5 and 6 where more than one ExOR is required to represent the
function. These Figures shows the step by step procedure to be followed.</p>

<p>Consider the function plotted on the K-map shown in Figure 5a. We might start by
plotting variable <b>a</b> as shown at 5b. This covers three of the 1s in the map but
places an additional 1 at position <b>abc</b>. (The additional 1s in Figures 5 and 6 are
shown greyed). We might next plot variable <b>c</b> as shown at 5c. This cancels the extra
1 at <b>abc</b>, covers the 1s at position <b>a'bc</b> and <b>a'b'c</b> but cancels the 1
at position <b>ab'c</b>. To regain a 1 at this position we place an additional 1 there and
map that position as shown at 5d. This gives the final result as shown below the K-map at
5d.</p>

<p>From a practical point of view we might implement the resulting expression as follows
(since there is generally only one ExOR function available in a CPLD macrocell): </p>

<table border="0" width="66%">

    <td width="38%"><p align="right">y </td>

    <td width="62%"><big>= </big>a'<big> </big><font FACE="Symbol" size="3"></font><font size="3"> (c(ab')')'</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The last line is for NAND gate implementation (a NAND gate has the form (ab)' )</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig6.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="363" alt="Figure 6">Another example is shown in Figure 6. The same steps are taken as was done
in Figure 5. The function is shown plotted on a K-map at 6a. We start as before by
plotting variable <b>a</b> as shown at 6b, since this looks like a suitable starting
point. This covers two of the 1s in the function but introduces two additional 1s. Next we
plot variable <b>b</b> as shown in 6c. This cancels one of the unwanted 1s that were
introduced in 6b but also cancels one of the 1s that we wanted to keep and introduces an
additional 1 at <b>a'bc</b>. Finally we add the plot for variable <b>c</b>. As you can see
this restores the 1 at <b>abc</b> covers the 1 at <b>a'b'c</b> and cancels the unwanted 1s
at <b>a'bc</b> and <b>ab'c</b>. The final (well known) result is shown under the K-map at
6d as it was in Figure 5.</p>

<p>To summarise what we have done to find ExOR forms of functions using the K-map: We
started by making an arbitrary choice of first plot, which covered some of the minterms
but possibly introduced unwanted minterms, we then made another choice of mapping which
covered more of the required minterms and possibly eliminated some of the unwanted
minterms and we continued the process until we had covered the complete function. The
method is somewhat heuristic but at least in general the method gives the result in a
direct way for functions with a small number of variables.</p>

<p>The last example will show a slightly different way of using the K-map. Assume that you
entered the following expression into your CPLD Hardware Description Language software:</p>

<p><img SRC="Concepts/fig7.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="306" HEIGHT="235" alt="Figure 7"> <font FACE="Courier New" size="2">y = ac'd' + abc + ab'd + b'c'd + a'b'cd'</font><font FACE="Courier New" size="3"></p>
</font>

<p>The compiler in your CPLD software has came up with the following expression for this
logic function and you would like to confirm that it is the same function:</p>

<p><font FACE="Courier New" size="2">y = a </font><font FACE="Symbol" size="2"></font><font FACE="Courier New" size="2"> (b'cd' + abc'd + a'b'c'd)</font></p>

<p>The K-map shown in Figure 7 confirms the identity. Note that we can plot all the terms
in parenthesis as a function and use this as a whole with the ExOR approach with the term <b>a</b>.
A reduction of five product terms to three is achieved with this function. The use of the
K-map is obviously a lot less work than expanding out the ExOR function.</p>

</b>

<p>This is as far as we will go in this paper. However, it is possible to treat the
simplification of ExOR forms of equations by a systematic algebraic procedure. This
procedure should be used for functions with four or more variables if the minimal form of
the function is to be guaranteed. The algebraic simplification procedure is described in
part 2. This paper has presented all of the preliminary requirements for the algebraic
method of simplification of ExOR functions. As a clue, you may recall that simplification
methods for the AND, OR invert algebra depended on making systematic use of the relation:
x + x' = 1 and the distributive theorem. For the ExOR algebra we will make systematic use
of the relation: x <font FACE="Symbol"></font> x' = 1 and a few rules.</p>

<p>This paper has demonstrated that a complete Boolean algebra can be developed in terms
of the exclusive-OR operator in place of the inclusive-OR operator. Examples have been
given that demonstrate the use of this approach to Boolean algebra. The exclusive-OR
algebra adds to and does not replace inclusive-OR algebra. The algebra is complete with
simplification methods including the use of conventional Karnaugh maps. The method of
using a conventional Karnaugh map for dealing with exclusive-OR functions was shown and
illustrated with examples.</p>
