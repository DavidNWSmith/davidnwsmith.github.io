<p>6. We each rode on an elephant.</p>

<p>7. When my hat blew off Richard's elephant picked it up and handed it (or rather
trunked it) to her driver, who handed it back to me, saving me a long walk back for the
hat. I was amazed by the intelligence of the elephants, they seemed to be fully aware of
what was going on and particularly liked to impress visitors with their huge ears. These
were only young elephants but they certainly looked impressive and massive with their huge
ears fully extended. Sitting on the back of the elephant, the ground looked a long way
down. We mounted and dismounted from the elephants at the top of a specially constructed
wooden platform, reached by a short flight of wooden steps.</p>

<p>The ride was a bit uncomfortable but memorable. Riding on the elephant was our second
activity for the day. At one point my elephant brought up a considerable amount of water,
which splashed on the path in front of us. The driver of my elephant said that these
elephants could carry 20 litres of water in their stomachs and retrieve it with their
trunks when they needed it. When we went down a steep slope I was afraid we might roll
over and get squashed but the driver said not to worry these animals were the four wheel
drives of the bush. The elephant made sure it didn't roll over but broke into a slow trot
when it neared the bottom. There were no foot holds in the canvas covers on the elephants,
so we hung on to the driver, especially going down the steep slope. &quot;They hadn't lost
a single customer&quot; the driver said.</p>

<p>8. The elephant in the next picture first put her trunk back and opened her mouth,
which is the elephant's way of asking for a food reward but when she saw I had nothing for
her but could see the camera in my hand she displayed her ears for me. Unfortunately the
background in the picture is a bit over exposed.</p>

<p>9. When the elephants had finished giving rides, the drivers removed the canvas covers
which we had been sitting on and after receiving their last few food rewards from whoever
had anything to give them, the elephants walked into the river, swam across, had a lie
down and a rest on the other side, got up again and congratulated each other on their
encounter as you can see in the next picture. After a while they walked back into the
bush. On reflection they might have been dusting themselves off.</p>

<p>10. We saw some long faces (probably Tsessebes) during the horse driven cart ride to
see the wild life. We saw a variety of antelope species, including zebras but the giraffes
eluded us. We saw vultures circling overhead and sitting in the top of a big tree. There
was more to see on the cart ride, including water birds but we had to cut it short to walk
with the lionesses.</p>

<p>10. An excellent lunch including vegetarian, which was included in the entrance price
and ordered the day before, was announced by a drum beat given by the cooking staff.</p>
