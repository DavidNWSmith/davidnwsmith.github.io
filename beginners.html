<h2></font><font size="4">Beginners and Bystanders Article</font><font SIZE="2"></h2>

<p></font><font size="3">This article is written for anyone unfamiliar with digital
circuits but who would like to get some idea of what it is about. </p>

<p>A few basic ideas including an actual working circuit will be presented in a graphical
manner with the help of animated GIF images. No attempt will be made to describe any
theoretical concepts. Of course the theory is what allows a designer to produce useful
digital circuits, so you would need to know more about that if you wanted to design
digital circuits yourself. Digital design is a bit like a Chinese puzzle box, it looks
very difficult at a casual glance but is (relatively) easy if you know how. You will have
the opportunity to call up the animated GIF files separately when you are ready to see
them.</p>

<p>The first clue is that we are talking about a special type of electrical circuit. This
type of circuit is entirely constructed from a small number of different types of building
block circuits. Each of these circuits has one or more input connections and one output
connection. The signals that we apply to the inputs and can observe on outputs, with a
test meter, have a special characteristic. The signals are always at one or the other of
two voltage levels. To simplify matters we will think of these voltage levels as either
high (voltage) or low (voltage). We call these signals logic signals and the circuits
themselves logic circuits. As an alternative to calling the signals high or low we can
call them true or false respectively when we think of the circuits as logic circuits.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" width="76%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFEA"></font><font size="3"><strong>Historical digression.</strong>
    We call these circuits logic circuits because the theory that we use for describing them
    was invented by a mathematician who developed the mathematical theory of logic. The
    mathematician was George Boole who published his book &quot;An Investigation of the Laws
    of Thought&quot; in 1854. Boole's concepts became a formal way of arguing about
    mathematical fundamentals. In the 1930's Claude Shannon realised the significance of this
    theory for the description of relay and switching circuits and wrote his thesis on the
    application of this concept to switching circuit design. His account of his thesis &quot;A
    Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;, Trans. A.I.E.E., vol 57, pp
    713-723, was published in 1938 for the benefit of the engineering community. Shannon's
    paper makes quaint but insightful reading with today's hindsight. Of course in those days
    telephone exchanges used mechanical relays, which was a major application for this
    development. The technology that we use now came along in 1948 when Brattain, Bardeen and
    Shockly at the Bell Telephone Laboratories published their invention of the transistor and
    not long after in 1959 when planar transistors were produced. This has started the
    revolution in integrated circuits that has accelerated the automation of information
    technology that we enjoy today. The theory that has developed, from Shannon's original
    contribution, in the intervening years is just as applicable to today's logic circuitry as
    it is for relay and switching circuits.</font></td>

<p></font><font size="3">When a signal makes a transition from low to high or high to low,
it does so very quickly. For this exposition we will ignore the fact that the signals
actually have to pass through intermediate values in making a transition. Real circuits
conform to this ideal very well indeed.</p>

<p>So now we have arrived at the understanding that we have building block circuits in
which all signals are either at the high (true) voltage level or the low (false) voltage
level and can make near instantaneous transitions between the two levels.</p>

<p>The building block circuits with more than one input are called gates, whilst a
building block circuit with only one input is a buffer or an inverter. We call the many
input circuits gates because of the way they allow or prevent a signal from passing
through. We will only consider 2-input gates but gates can have as many inputs as are
needed. The buffer circuit simply boosts the driving power of a signal of whatever
polarity without changing the polarity so that it can drive many more inputs to other
circuits, whilst an inverter changes the signal level from whatever the input signal level
is to the opposite signal level on its output. When we draw symbols for the circuits we
will represent the operation of inversion by a small circle usually on the output side of
the symbol.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

    the basic logic gates and the inverter.</strong></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div><font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="3">For our immediate purpose, only three of the various gate types
will be described. These and the inverter are shown in Figure 1. In keeping with the idea
of logic, the inverter is labelled NOT. In the figure two of the symbols have a small
inversion circle on their outputs.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the AND gate is such that the output remains low whilst either or both
of the inputs is low and goes high when both inputs go high. In other words, in the AND
gate, the first input AND the second input must be high for the output to go high.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the OR gate is such that the output goes high as soon as either or
both inputs goes high. In other words the OR gate output goes high if the first input OR
the second input or in fact if both inputs go high. <em>AND gates together with OR gates
and inverters are sufficient by themselves, at least in principle, to create the logic
part of any desired digital circuit.</em> However, there are several other gate types that
are useful to digital designers. One other such circuit is the NAND gate which we will
need for the demonstration circuit. In the demonstration circuit we will only use 2-input
NAND gates and inverters.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the NAND gate is similar to the AND gate except that the output goes
the opposite way to the AND gate. The output of the NAND gate is high as long as either or
both inputs are low and goes low when both inputs are high. You can see from the symbol
for the NAND gate in Figure 1 that the NAND gate is shown as an AND gate followed by a
NOT.</p>

<p>In the animation a <font color="#FF0000">high</font> signal is coloured <font color="#FF0000">red</font> and a <font color="#00FF00">low</font> signal is coloured <font color="#00FF00">green</font>. You will see all the possible combinations of inputs on each
gate and the resulting outputs of the gates. Look at each gate individually until you get
the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>Click on Figure 1 to see the animation.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<h3></font><font size="3">A complete circuit to show you what can be done</font><font SIZE="2"></h3>

<p></font><font size="3">Now that you have got the idea of how the gates work I will show
you a circuit to demonstrate something working. You can follow how it works through the
animation and relating what you see to the way the gates work. In fact, after setting the
scene for you, I will leave you to follow it through. You may need some persistence to do
this thoroughly but that is the nature of the way it is. Digital design theory offers
better ways of dealing with these circuits.</p>

<p>The concept of the example is somewhat simplified for the sake of the exposition. The
idea is to detect a car going the wrong way down a one way street. The two light beams
across the road give low signals to the P and Q inputs until a car breaks the beams. When
a beam is broken the input to the circuit goes high. This is performed by additional
circuitry not shown in the diagram. The warning light is assumed connected to the output
of the circuit and changes from <font color="#00FF00">green</font> to <font color="#FF0000">red</font> when a car is detected going the wrong way down the street.</p>

<p>Follow how the signals propagate through the circuit in response to the signals
generated by the beams as they are broken and restored. Use the rules for the gates
described earlier to see what is happening in the circuit. The same arrangement as before
is used where a <font color="#FF0000">high</font> signal is shown in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>
and a <font color="#00FF00">low</font> signal is shown in <font color="#00FF00">green</font>.

repetitions so get your bearings during the first 10 seconds whilst you wait for the
animation to start. Click on one of the cars in the Figure 2 to see the animation for the

<h3><font size="3">What else should be said?</h3>

<p>I should put in a bit of a disclaimer here. The circuit shown is not intended to be the
ultimate solution to any particular problem. The example circuit is intended purely to
give the reader something to try out the ideas presented. The idea of cars travelling down
a road is simply to make it sound more interesting. There are nearly always alternative
solutions possible to any given problem. A student would be expected to investigate other
possible solutions and consider the merits of any solutions found. If you were going to
study digital design with a view to becoming a designer you would not actually start with
a circuit like the one shown. Quite a lot of ground work is needed before this type of
circuit is studied.</p>

<p>The idea of using light beams across the road to detect cars passing is also not a good
idea but simplified the preparation of the drawings. Loops under the road with suitable
detection equipment would be a better idea. These would be less prone to interference by
passing pedestrians. Any actual design problem requires a great many considerations
relating to implementation to be thought through before it becomes an acceptable solution.</p>

<p>If you would like to make a start with the theory you can read an introductory article
on Boolean Algebra by following the button below. This article is intended to provide the
background required for the remaining articles. One omission from this article that you
might need to properly understand the subject is a discussion of binary numbers. Most
beginning books on digital design give the necessary explanation of number systems. The
Boolean algebra article became too long for a single page so I have split it over two
pages.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
