<p>12. The feature of the Antelope Park was a &quot;A Walk with Lions&quot;. These were
the two 8 month old lionesses in a playful mood that we walked with. The Park was
dedicated to restoring lion numbers in the wild that had dropped from an estimated quarter
of a million to just 17,000. &quot;Give in or I will tear your face off&quot;.</p>

<p>15. Walking with one of the lionesses near the end of the day. The lionesses were taken
for a walk three times a day. The sticks were to keep the lionesses at bay if they got too
playful. We didn't need them so they served as walking sticks, which we handed back at the
end of the walk after the lionesses were put back in their enclosure for the night. When
one of the keepers went ahead to take this picture, the lionesses thought it was a new
game and bounded after him. It took some time for them to settle down so that we could get
the picture.</p>

<p>16. Playing on the jetty. The planks on the jetty were good to chew on. &quot;I'm just
checking for a loose plank that I can rip off and chew on&quot;.</p>

planned and exciting day.</p>
