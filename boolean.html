<p>George Boole made major contributions to the development of mathematical logic and
published a book <i>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic</i> in 1847. The system of
mathematics which he described in his book has become known as Boolean algebra. Boole was
a self taught mathematician who discovered the power of mathematics early in life and
became a leading figure in mathematical circles. Boolean algebra became a systematic
method of dealing with symbolic logic and a much used method of arguing about the
fundamentals of mathematics.</p>

<p>In 1938 Claude Shannon published an extract from his Masters thesis entitled: <i>A
Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits</i>. Shannon made use of Boolean algebra
to develop a system that described the logical relationships in switching circuits with
simplification of these circuits as one objective. Essentially this provided an algebraic
method of describing and manipulating switching circuits. In 1938 there were no logic gate
circuits. Electromechanical relay circuits used by the Post Office and in control circuits
were the main motivation for developing switching circuit theory.</p>

<p>The original application of Boolean algebra was for working with formal logic and the
logical foundations of mathematics. Consequently a formal approach has developed for
dealing with these applications. In this paper the purpose of using Boolean algebra is to
provide techniques for working with digital circuits. The formal methods of presenting
Boolean algebra are not suitable here. We will use the <i>truth table</i> method that
Shannon described in his 1938 paper. The truth table method of proof, described later,
will easily give us all the results we need.</p>

<p>Boolean algebra provides an algebraic method of working with all types of digital
circuitry, including integrated circuit gates and circuits based on physical switch
contacts. This allows us to replace physical arguments that can become complicated to
think about when dealing with these circuits with precise application of theorems that
will eliminate any concern about the correctness of the results. You will find that this
is an advantageous way of working with digital circuits. Some of the theorems of Boolean
algebra can appear simplistic at first glance but you will see that the results further
into the subject lead to quite elegant and non intuitive results.</p>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a>Basic <a name="assumptions">assumptions</a></h4>

<p>All systems of mathematics are based on a set of preliminary statements called
postulates that do not depend on prior proof. To get the algebra started we will make the
following statements: Boolean algebra has constants and variables. There are only two
values for the constants and variables which we take to be 0 and 1. A constant has either
the value 0 or 1 whilst a variable can take either value.Variables are usually represented
by letters of the alphabet for describing the algebra and with mnemonics or abbreviations
for real applications.</p>

<p>Boolean algebra is described as a finite algebra due to the finite number of values
that are represented in the algebra. This is not the same thing as a binary number in
which the individual digits of the number have only the values 0 or 1. In Boolean algebra
there are only two values all together. This is the basic abstraction on which the algebra
is based.</p>

<p>The two values 0 and 1 are regards as inverses of each other. There is only one
possible inverse in a Boolean algebra that has only two values. The inverse of a constant
or variable has the opposite value of the constant or variable itself. We will represent
the inverse of a variable by placing a prime (i.e. straight single quote) immediately
after the variable. We will sometimes refer to this prime as an exponent. Because there is
only one possible inverse in this algebra the exponent has only two values. We can
represent these two values by either using the prime if the inverse is intended or
otherwise leave it out.</p>

<p>You might note that we could have a Boolean algebra with say three values which we
might take as 0, 1 and 2. This would be called a ternary Boolean algebra. The complexity
of Boolean algebras increases very rapidly when you increase the number of values it can
have beyond two. We will stick to two valued (or binary) Boolean algebra.</p>

<p>In a gate circuit the logic levels in the circuit are described as a high or a low
signal level. In an actual gate circuit the signals may not all be exactly at the same
high or low level. Also when the signals are changing from one level to the other they
have to pass through all the intermediate values. These details are ignored for the
purpose of the algebra. In an actual circuit signal transitions are made very quickly, in
the order of nanoseconds in today&#146;s gate circuits. The minimum high signal level and
maximum low signal level that are determined to give the circuit a reliable performance
are specified for a given family of circuits. The algebra that we are developing will be
concerned with the functional behaviour of digital circuits rather than the instantaneous
values of signal levels in the circuits.</p>

<p>In the case of a circuit which contains mechanical switches and relays the logic levels
for the circuit may be described as open circuit or closed circuit.</p>

<p>We can and will develop the algebra independently of the actual components that we
intend to use in the implementation of the circuit. A logic 1 value will represent any of
the expressions: 1, high, closed circuit or logic true. A logic 0 value will represent any
of the expressions: 0, low, open circuit or logic false. The terms used for the logic
values may be used interchangeably if called for by the context of a particular
description. We will use the values 0 and 1 exclusively in the development of the algebra.</p>

<p>Whilst the assumptions made are completely adequate for dealing with the logic in the
circuitry it is accepted that there are always delays through every part of a real
circuit. These delays are both necessary and a source of problems in a real circuit. We
will ignore them completely in this paper but they need to be considered carefully in the
design procedures of synchronous circuits and in some other situations. Delays in an
electrical circuit are a bit like the friction that exists in a mechanical system.</p>

<p>In a real digital circuit design, it is necessary to take into account the loading
effects on a gate's output that drives many inputs to other gates. There are limitations
on real gates specified by a manufacturer as fan in and fan out limits. Implementation
details such as this will also be ignored in this paper. There will be more on the subject
of postulates later in this paper.</p>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The <a name="convention">convention</a> used for drawing switching circuits</h4>

<p>Note that if you are drawing a circuit consisting of mechanical switches or relay
contacts you should draw the circuit according to the following convention: A logic true
contact is shown on the circuit as an open contact and a logic false contact is shown as a
closed contact. The reason for this apparent inconsistency is that all switch contacts
should be shown in their normally unenergised positions. So when a logic true contact is
energised it becomes a closed contact. Also when a logic false contact is energised it
becomes an open circuit. Failure to follow this convention will result in confusion when
the circuit is analysed or when it is wired into an actual circuit.</p>
<b>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>Some <a name="basic gates">basic gate</a> circuits</h4>

<p>Before we can start developing design methods for digital circuits we need to become
acquainted with the theorems of Boolean algebra. First we will look at a few basic gate
circuits.</p>

<p><img src="Boolean/BasicGates.gif" alt="Some Basic Gates" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="160">
  There are a number of basic gate circuits found in digital circuits. The most
  important of these are shown in Figure 1. The AND gate has the property that the output of
  the gate will be high only if both inputs are high. The output of the OR gate will be high
  if either or both inputs are high. The exclusive OR circuit labelled XOR (ExOR was previously used in these pages)
  has an output that is high if either but not both inputs are high
  together. The output of the NOT (or inverter) circuit provides the inverse of the signal
  on its input. The NAND and NOR circuits are the same as the AND and OR circuits but with
  an inverter on their outputs.</p>

<p>An inversion is shown as a small circle in these symbols. Whilst the inversion circle
is shown on the output side of three of the symbols shown in Figure 1, symbols can be
drawn with inversion symbols on the input sides of the symbols as well. Also each of the
gate circuits are shown with two inputs but actual gate circuits can have as many inputs
as are required within the physical limitations of the circuits.</p>
<b>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The
Boolean algebra <a name="operators">operators</a></h4>

<p>When the gate circuits have only two inputs they can be regarded as binary operators
for use in the algebra. Similarly the inverter can be regarded as a unary operator. There
are three distinct binary operators for (binary) Boolean algebra and only one unary
operator. The binary operators are the AND operator, the OR operator and the XOR
operator. The unary operator is the inverter or NOT circuit. The justification for these
statements is demonstrated later in this page. The Boolean algebra that we will develop
will be based on these three binary operators and the unary or inverter operator.</p>

<p><img src="Boolean/operators.gif" alt="The three binary operators" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="408" HEIGHT="249">The three distinct binary operators are shown in Figure 2. This
figure shows the graphical symbols for the operators, the equivalent switching circuits
and the truth tables for the operators.</p>

<p>The truth tables are lists showing the conditions under which the operator has logic
true and false values. All possible variations of the input variables are shown on the
left of the table (in binary numerical order) and the resulting output from the operator
is shown on the right of the table. For the AND operator, the truth table shows that the
output of the AND gate is high only when both inputs of the gate are high or that the
output of the switching circuit is a closed circuit only when both switches in the circuit
are closed. The truth tables follow the statements of the behaviour of these operators.</p>

<p>For the OR operator, the truth table shows that the output of the OR gate is high when
either or both inputs of the gate are high or that the output of the switching circuit is
a closed circuit when either or both switches in the circuit are closed.</p>

<p>For the XOR operator, the truth table shows that the output of the XOR gate is high
when one or the other but not both inputs of the XOR gate are high. The switch circuit
version of the XOR shown in Figure 2 shows how the XOR function can be cascaded in a
switching circuit. Both the logic true and logic false signals are carried through a chain
of these circuits since a relay would otherwise be required to produce the inverse of a
signal. The switch circuit can be constructed with a double pole double throw switch.</p>

<p><img src="_borders/inverter.gif" alt="NOT operator" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="245">The
inverse operator is shown in Figure 3. The use of a relay is shown for the switch circuit
inverter. A Boolean expression consisting of variables and operators is known as a Boolean
function.</p>

<p>The symbols used for the operators in Boolean functions and formulas are: a dot (or
frequently an &amp;) for the AND operator. The OR symbol is usually a + (arithmetic plus
symbol). The XOR symbol is a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> . This symbol is sometimes
referred to as a modulo-2 or mod-2 sum symbol. If the variables are represented by single
letters the AND symbol between the variables is usually omitted. Therefore the absence of
an operator symbol between variables is taken to be an AND operator. A logic false
variable or function is represented by a prime after the variable or function.</p>

<p>The AND function has been compared by early authors of this subject with the arithmetic
multiplication operation for the digits 0 and 1, which it matches exactly. The OR
operation for the digits 0 and 1 has been compared with the arithmetic SUM operation. The
only difference for this case is that the arithmetic 1 + 1 equals 2, whereas the Boolean
OR for 1 + 1 equals 1. Therefore it is common practice to refer to a Boolean function of
AND operators as a product term or just a term and a Boolean function of OR operators as a
sum. The XOR operator can be compared with the remainder after dividing the arithmetic
sum by 2. Hence the terminology mod-2 for this operator.</p>

<p>If the product terms are separated by OR operators, the function is referred to as a
Sum-Of-Products (or SOP). A function consisting of groups of OR operators separated by AND
operators is referred to as a POS. A Boolean function of AND operators separated by XOR
operators is often referred to as an Exclusive-OR-Sum-Of-Products (or ESOP).</p>
<b>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The basic <a name="theorems">theorems</a> of Boolean algebra</h4>

<p><img src="Boolean/Theorem1.gif" alt="Basic Theorems" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="501">There is a group of four basic theorems for each of the binary operators
that are constructed by applying the following pairs of signals to the two inputs of each
of the operators: Applying the same signal to both inputs, applying a signal and its
inverse to the two inputs, applying a signal and a logic 0 to the two inputs and applying
a signal and a logic 1 to the two inputs. The complete procedure for carrying this out is
shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p>In the truth table method of proof we simply apply the values in the truth tables of
the operators to each of the theorems. This method of proof makes use of the fact that
because of the finite number of values of the variables involved we can quickly fill in
all possibilities and find the results directly. This method of proof is completely
adequate to derive all the results we need. However, after deriving some of the results in
this way we will be able to derive additional results by application of the theorems
already derived.</p>

<p>In Figure 4, the four basic theorems for each of the three binary operators have been
found. The operators themselves are shown at the top of Figure 4 and the values from these
operators have been filled in on the right hand sides of each of the theorem truth tables.
The results for each of these theorems has been written down under the truth table for
each theorem.</p>

<p>Many of these theorems are obvious on physical grounds if you consider the
corresponding switch circuit. For example placing two contacts of the same switch in
series is no different to having a single contact of the switch. Placing a true and false
contact from the same switch in series can never produce a closed circuit, since when the
true contact is closed the false contact will be open and visa versa. However, we have not
used physical arguments to derive any of the theorems. We used the truth tables of the
basic operators themselves in every case.</p>

<p><i>The operators themselves are an essential part of the postulates of the algebra.</i></p>

Commutative, Associative and Distributive <a name="Laws">Laws</a></h4>

<p>In order to enable us to manipulate Boolean equations and functions we need to
establish three so-called laws. The commutative law refers to the order in which the
variables or terms are arranged in a formula. You can see from Figure 4 that we could have
reversed the order in which the variables were arranged for each theorem without changing
the results of the basic theorems developed there. Consequently we can write the
commutative law for each of the operators as follows:</p>

<table border="0" width="87%">

The associative law refers to the rearrangements of the parenthesis in an equation. It can
be stated as follows:<font face="Courier"></p>

proof yourself, it follows a similar procedure to that shown in Figure 5 for the
distributive laws. The distributive law shows us how to take a variable or function into
or out of parenthesis. These laws allow us to work with or manipulate functions of Boolean
variables.</p>

column in binary numerical order. Each of the other columns are filled in by evaluating
the expression at the top of the column using the values in the first column. To do the
evaluation we evaluate inside parenthesis first, then we evaluate product terms next and
sums last. We do each evaluation by using the values given in the truth tables for the
basic operators. Note that we are taking the absence of an operator shown between two
variables or constants to be an AND operator.</p>

<p>For example:<font face="Courier"></p>

<p></font>If<font face="Courier"> a=1 </font>and<font face="Courier"> b=c=0, </font>then:<font face="Courier"> a(b+c) = 1(0+0) = 10 = 0</p>

<p></font>If<font face="Courier"> a=b=1 </font>and<font face="Courier"> c=0, </font>then:<font face="Courier"> a(b+c) = 1(1+0) = 11 = 1</p>

<p></font>This gives us two of the values to fill in the table. We continue to fill in the
whole table in this way. If we do the same for the XOR case using the same values for the
variables then:<font face="Courier"></p>

<p></font>If<font face="Courier"> a=1 </font>and<font face="Courier"> b=c=0, </font>then:<font face="Courier"> a(b</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">c) = 1(0</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">0) = 10 = 0</font></p>

<p>If<font face="Courier"> a=b=1 </font>and<font face="Courier"> c=0, </font>then:<font face="Courier"> a(b</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">c) = 1(1</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">0) = 11 = 1</font></p>

<p>We evaluate all the entries for the table using the same procedure. The result is that:</p>

<table border="0" width="72%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Distributive law:</td>
    <td width="33%"><font face="Courier">a(b+c) = ab + ac</font></td>
    <td width="34%"><font face="Courier">a(b</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">c) = ab</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">ac</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is also a distributive law for the POS case with the AND and OR operators. This
is:</p>

<table border="0" width="63%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">POS Distributive law:</td>
    <td width="50%"><font face="Courier">(a+b)(a+c) = a+bc</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We can derive this result using the distributive law already established.</p>

<table border="0" width="625">
  <tr>
    <td width="104"><p align="right"><font face="Courier">(a+b)(a+c)</font></td>
    <td width="200"><font face="Courier">= a(a+b) + c(a+b)</font></td>
    <td width="303"><i>using the distributive law</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="104"></td>
    <td width="200"><font face="Courier">= aa + ab + ca + cb</font></td>
    <td width="303"><i>using the distributive law again</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="104"></td>
    <td width="200"><font face="Courier">= a(1 + b + c) + bc</font></td>
    <td width="303"><i>aa = a, distributive law, cb = bc</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="104"></td>
    <td width="200"><font face="Courier">= a + bc</font></td>
    <td width="303"><i>(1 + anything) = 1, a1 = a</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This shows the result given above. There is no similar result that is useful for an
XOR case. However, see the added note on page 2 to see how this fits in with the overall
picture.</p>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The <a name="inverse">inverse</a> of Boolean functions</h4>

<p>A truth table can be drawn up for any given function of Boolean variables. Each term in
the table has a 0 or 1 value. The inverse of a function is found by inverting all of the
values for the terms in the table. We effectively plot the 0s instead of the 1s. This
results from the property of the inverse operator.</p>

<p><img src="Boolean/InvLaws.gif" alt="Proofs of Inversion Laws" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="339" HEIGHT="357">In this section we will find the theorems for deriving the inverse of any given
Boolean function.</p>

<p>A Boolean function can have any of the three binary operators as part of it. However,
it will be seen that two independent algebras can be constructed out of the three binary
operators. These algebras are called the inclusive-OR algebra when AND, OR and inverters
are the operators for the algebra and exclusive-OR algebra when XOR operators replace the
OR operators. The two algebras have distinct inversion theorems.</p>

<p>The inversion theorems are derived in Figure 6. The theorem for the inclusive OR
algebra is generalised in the following statement: The inverse of any Boolean function of
the inclusive-OR algebra can be found by replacing all occurrences of AND operators with
OR operators, replacing all OR operators with AND operators, priming all unprimed
variables and unpriming all primed variables. This result for the inclusive-OR algebra is
called DeMorgan&#146;s theorem after a contemporary mathematician of George Boole who
formulated it.</p>

<p>The last truth table in Figure 6 shows two inversion theorems for the exclusive-OR
algebra. The second of these theorems also follows from the first by double inversion.
DeMorgan&#146;s theorem&#146;s are not applicable to the XOR algebra. In addition to
these two inversion theorems for the XOR operator the basic theorem <font face="Courier">a<span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>1=a&#146;</font> also relates to inversion. The inversion theorems
for the XOR operator are:</p>

<table border="0" width="340">

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The <a name="even">even</a> and odd properties of XOR algebra</h4>

<p>If a given term appears twice in a function connected by XOR operators, then the two
terms will cancel out. This results directly from the basic theorems of the XOR operator:
<font face="Courier">x</font> <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> <font face="Courier">x</font> <font face="Courier">=</font> <font face="Courier">0</font> and <font face="Courier">y</font><span class="xor">&nbsp;</span><font face="Courier">0</font> <font face="Courier">=</font> <font face="Courier">y</font>. Consequently the following
statements hold for the XOR algebra:</p>

    <td width="420">if an even number of the variables <font face="Courier"><i>x,y,z...</i></font>

    <td width="420">if an odd number of the variables <font face="Courier"><i>x,y,z...</i></font>

<p>An example of the use of this property is to use XOR operators in a parity generator.</p>

<h4><a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Top" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="12"></a></b>The <a name="basic">basic</a> operators of binary Boolean algebra</h4>

<p>Next we will review some considerations illustrated in Figure 7. This section has been
left to this point because we need the inversion theorems for part of the description.</p>

<p><img src="Boolean/Allops.gif" alt="All basic operators" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" WIDTH="521" HEIGHT="367">Figure 7 has been drawn up to clearly identify the distinctly
different binary operators of Boolean algebra. There are 16 variations of the four values
of the two variables to get all the possible operators. The equation represented by each
variation has been written in the middle column for each case in the list. You can
consider the binary numbers in the left hand column to be truth tables on their sides for
the expressions to their right.</p>

<p>Figure 7 shows that there are two cases of constants in the table and four cases of
single variables. These are six degenerate cases. There are ten cases of actual binary
operators. Of these ten cases there are four variations of AND functions, four variations
of OR functions and two variations of XOR functions. The variations are due to the values
of the exponents of the variables. There are four variations of the exponents of two
variables which gives the four variations of the AND and OR cases.</p>

<p>There are only two variations of the XOR functions. In the general case of a Boolean
function of two or more variables there are always only two XOR functions in which all of
the variables appear singly in the terms of the function. For example consider the
following function of three variables:</p>

<table border="0" width="546">
  <tr>
    <td width="67"></td>
    <td width="182"><font face="Courier">f = a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c</font></td>
    <td width="279"><font face="Courier">f&#146; = 1 <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> a <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> b <span class="xor">&nbsp;</span> c</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<font face="Courier">

<p></font>From the inversion theorem:<font face="Courier"> x<span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>y
= x&#146;<span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>y&#146;</font>, you can see that introducing primes
on pairs of variables in either of these expressions does not change the function.
Introducing a single prime on any one of the variables or adding the constant 1 (mod-2) to
the function inverts the function. Hence there are no other possibilities and there is
just the one case of the all single variables XOR function and its inverse no matter how
many variables there are in the function. The XOR function with two inputs is used as an
operator on these pages. However, see the added note on page 2 for additional
considerations.</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="2" width="85%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" bordercolor="#800000">

</center></div>

<p>Out of the ten cases of binary operators there are therefore just three distinctly
different binary operators of Boolean algebra, the AND, OR and XOR operators. The NAND
(1110) and NOR (1000) operators are seen to be included in the variations of the OR and
the AND operators respectively. A method of dealing with NAND and NOR gates will be
described shortly.</p>

<p>All Boolean functions have an inverse function. If <font face="Courier">f</font> is a
Boolean function, then <font face="Courier">1<span class="xor">&nbsp;</span>f</font> is the
inverse of the function. The two XOR functions are inverses of each other and the AND and
OR functions in Figure 7 are inverses of each other in pairs, a circumstance that leads to
duality in the Inclusive OR algebra.</p>
